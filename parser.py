''' _build_entry is a helper function. Its single job is to take one AST node (a function or a class from a Python file) and turn it into a neat dictionary that the rest of the tool can work with.
Think of it like repacking. The ast module gives you raw Python objects — _build_entry repacks them into a simple dictionary. Every function and class in the codebase will end up as one of these dictionaries.'''

def _build_entry(
    node: ast.FunctionDef | ast.ClassDef,  #function or class
    raw_source: str,  #entire file is just a big string , ast.get_source_segment needs raw text to extract code of this function or class 
    file_path: Path, 
    kind: str,        #doesnt itself figure out if its function or class , the caller tells it
) -> dict[str, Any]:
    
    doc = ast.get_docstring(node) or ""

    #ast.unparse() converts ast node back into string of python
    # i think ast.get_source_segment ususally works but returns none in a few edge cases
    # in that case ast.unparse is a fallback , it recreates python code from the ast itself 
    # so youd never end up with none source. 
    # 
    # but the tradeoff is that unparse doesnt preserve origiinal formatting 
    # , comments or whitespace.

i think it read text from path , then parsed it then checked if it is function or classes 

and depending on what it is , it added it to results '''
